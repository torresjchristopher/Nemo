```
You → Your Machine → RL Agent (Local) → Nothing Leaves
      (Your data is YOUR asset. Always.)
```

### The Guarantee in Writing

**Nemo will NEVER:**
- ❌ Store your keystrokes externally

## Machine-Breaking Capabilities

### Why "Machine Breaking"?

Nemo breaks traditional keyboard limitations:

**Traditional Keyboard:**
- One function at a time
- No context awareness
- No learning
- No temporal navigation
- No AI synthesis
- Data leaks to cloud

**Nemo Keyboard:**
- 4 revolutionary functions
- **Full context awareness** (groundbreaking)
- **Reinforced learning** (adaptive)
- **Temporal navigation** (past/future)
- **AI synthesis** (on-device)
- **Data invisible** (stays local)

### What "Machine Breaking" Means

We're breaking:
1. **The keyboard paradigm** - From input device to context engine
2. **The data paradigm** - From "your data is ours" to "your data is yours"
3. **The AI paradigm** - From cloud-dependent to local-intelligent
4. **The learning paradigm** - From static models to adaptive agents
5. **The privacy paradigm** - From privacy theater to privacy guarantee

## Reinforced Learning in Practice

### How Nemo Learns (Without Storing)

**The Loop:**
1. You press a key
2. Nemo observes context (screenshot, keystrokes, files, apps)
3. **RL agent analyzes patterns** (on your machine)
4. **Agent adapts behavior** (learns preferences)
5. Next interaction is smarter
6. Data is processed, then forgotten
7. Loop repeats forever

**The Key:** Learning happens locally. Data doesn't persist. You benefit from learning without data leakage.

### Examples of Groundbreaking Context

**Example 1: Voice Input**
```
Traditional: "Weather San Francisco"
            → Sends to cloud
            → Returns generic forecast

Nemo: Sees you're writing email, calendar open to trip dates
     → Understands you need weather for your trip
     → Synthesizes with full context
     → Returns personalized forecast with trip details
     → All on your machine
```

**Example 2: Temporal Rewind**
```
Traditional: "Undo" button
            → Last keystroke only
            → Can't go back 2 hours

Nemo: Hold RIGHT ALT + LEFT
     → Browse entire week backwards
     → See what happened at any moment
     → Full context restored
     → Choose what to undo/restore
```

**Example 3: Reinforced Learning**
```
Day 1: You use Nemo 50 times
      → Agent learns your patterns

Day 2: You use Nemo 50 times
      → Agent is 20% more accurate
      → Predicts your needs better
      → Suggests features you'll want

Week 1: You use Nemo 300+ times
       → Agent understands your workflow deeply
       → Anticipates your needs
       → Adapts to your style
```

### 3. Data Invisibility
We **guarantee** data never leaves your machine. That's not privacy theater—it's architecture.

### 4. Machine-Breaking Design
We're not incrementally improving keyboards. We're **redefining what they do**.

### 5. Made in America
Built with American innovation values: transparency, privacy, freedom.
