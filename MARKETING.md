# Nemo Marketing: Temporal Git for Your Life

## 🎯 The Pitch

**Nemo is Git for your entire life.**

Just as Git lets you commit, branch, and rewind code changes, Nemo commits your entire desktop every 15 minutes. Your week becomes a browsable timeline. One-week temporal window. Full context. Netflix scrubbing.

### The Problem We Solve

- **Forgotten context:** "What was I working on 3 days ago?"
- **Lost work:** "I just deleted something important. Can't undo."
- **Workflow mysteries:** "How did I get from here to there?"
- **Fear of change:** "What if I break something?"

### The Solution: Temporal Git

Nemo captures **complete desktop state** every 15 minutes:
- Screenshots (what you see)
- Keystrokes (what you type)
- File changes (what you modify)
- App context (what's open)

Then you browse like **Netflix**. Jump to any moment. See what happened. Restore if needed.

## 💡 Core Claims

### 1. **Groundbreaking Context Evaluation**
We don't just track changes—we capture **full temporal context**. Every snapshot is a complete, restorable moment in time.

**What's stored per snapshot:**
- 📸 Screenshot (compressed, searchable via OCR)
- ⌨️ Keystroke history (for reversal/replay)
- 📁 File state (diffs, timestamps, contents)
- 🪟 App metadata (what was open, window positions)

**Why it matters:** You can restore your *entire desktop* to any moment, not just undo the last action.

### 2. **One-Week Temporal Window**
Access 7 days of history with efficient compression (~2MB/day, ~14MB total).

**What you get:**
- 96 snapshots per day (15-min intervals)
- 672 temporal commits in a week
- Complete backward/forward scrubbing
- Automatic archival (2-week retention, configurable)

**Why it matters:** A week of history is the sweet spot—long enough to forget, short enough to store efficiently.

### 3. **Netflix-Style Timeline Browser**
Scrub through your week like you scrub through a movie. Hover to preview. Click to jump. Visual temporal navigation.

**Coming Q2-Q3 2026:**
- Horizontal timeline scrubber
- Moment previews on hover
- Calendar-style month view
- Tagging & bookmarking
- Search (by app, file, keystroke)
- Productivity heatmaps

**Why it matters:** Boring time travel becomes intuitive, fun, and fast.

### 4. **Full Context Backward AND Forward**
Most tools only go backward (undo). Nemo lets you scrub in *both* directions.

**Backward scrubbing:**
- "What was on my screen 2 hours ago?"
- "Where did that file come from?"
- "Restore my desktop to 3 days ago"

**Forward scrubbing:**
- "How did this evolve over time?"
- "Show me the progression"
- "Learn from my past workflow"

**Why it matters:** Temporal understanding, not just temporal undo.

### 5. **Zero Data Leakage**
Everything stays on your machine. No cloud, no telemetry, no external uploads. Privacy by architecture.

**Privacy guarantees:**
- 🔒 Local storage only (no servers)
- 🔐 Encrypted snapshots (in-transit encryption)
- 👁️ Optional local backup only
- 🚫 Zero telemetry (we don't know what you do)

**Why it matters:** Trust is the foundation of temporal computing.

### 6. **Proprietary NEMO Code Powers Perfect Reversal**
Perfect 5-minute rewind is powered by **NEMO Code**—proprietary, locked, unreplicable.

- ✅ Perfect reversal every time (flawless)
- ✅ Logic is never disclosed (competitive advantage)
- ✅ Can't be reverse-engineered (mechanism locked)
- ✅ Users get value (rewind works)

**Why it matters:** What makes Nemo unreplicable is what we don't tell you. Perfect rewind without the blueprint.

## 💰 Positioning Strategy

### Premium Positioning
- Not a "backup tool" (everyone has those)
- Not a "recovery utility" (those are reactive)
- **Nemo is a temporal OS layer** (fundamental)

### The Narrative
1. **Today:** Undo one step at a time (painful)
2. **Tomorrow (v1.5):** Undo with perfect keystroke handling (complete)
3. **Next month (v2):** Temporal snapshots like Git (comprehensive)
4. **Later (v3):** Netflix scrubbing through your week (intuitive)
5. **Industry standard (v5+):** Temporal computing is how all OS work

---

## 🎬 The Vision (5-Year)

**Year 1 (2026):** Desktop temporal computing (Windows)
**Year 2 (2027):** macOS + Linux + full week coverage
**Year 3 (2028):** Mobile OS temporal awareness
**Year 4 (2029):** NemoOS prototype (temporal as core)
**Year 5+ (2030+):** Industry adoption (rewind becomes standard)

### The Endgame
> In 5 years, "non-rewindable computing" will seem barbaric. Nemo started it.
