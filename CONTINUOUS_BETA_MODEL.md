# Nemo: The Continuous Beta Model

## What Does "Continuous Beta" Mean?

**Not:** "Here's v1.0, wait for v2.0 next year"  
**Instead:** "Here's v1.0, watch it evolve every week based on your feedback"

---

## The Gameplan

### Traditional Software
```
v1.0 Release ─→ (wait 6-12 months) ─→ v2.0 Release
                  User features: None
                  Developer agility: Locked in
```

### Nemo's Continuous Beta
```
v1.0 Launch ─→ v1.1 ─→ v1.2 ─→ v1.3 ─→ v1.4 ─→ v1.5 ─→ v2.0
   (now)    (1 week) (2 wks) (3 wks) (1 mo) (6 wks) (Q2 2026)
   
Every update: Community feedback → New features → Patch notes → Excitement
```

## The Vision: Temporal Git Reality

**Where we're going:** Your entire week is browsable like Netflix  
**How we get there:** Together, with community guidance  
**When we arrive:** Q2-Q3 2026 (Netflix UI), Q3 2026 (full week)  
**Who's building it:** You, the community, and our team  

**You're not waiting for the future. You're building it.**

## Beta Expectations

### What "Beta" Means Here
✅ **Stable** - Core features work reliably  
✅ **Safe** - Your data stays on your machine  
✅ **Updated** - New features constantly  
✅ **Community-guided** - You shape direction  
✅ **Transparent** - All decisions visible  

### What "Beta" Does NOT Mean
❌ **Unstable** - Crashes frequently  
❌ **Risky** - Your data at risk  
❌ **Abandoned** - No active development  
❌ **Closed** - No user feedback  
❌ **Hidden** - Secret plans only  

**This is a "beta" in the sense of "always evolving," not "broken and incomplete."**
