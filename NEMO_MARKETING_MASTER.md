## 🚀 What Makes Nemo Revolutionary

### 1. **Complete Context Preservation**
Not just files, not just changes. Everything.

- 📸 Screenshots (what you see)
- ⌨️ Keystrokes (what you type)
- 📁 File changes (what you modify)
- 🪟 App context (what's open)

**Why it matters:** You can restore your entire desktop to any moment, not just undo the last action.

### 2. **One-Week Temporal Window**
7 days of history in ~14MB (compressed).

- 96 snapshots per day (15-min intervals)
- Complete backward/forward browsing
- Full restoration capability
- Efficient compression (200KB per snapshot)

**Why it matters:** A week is the sweet spot—long enough to forget, short enough to store efficiently.

### 3. **Netflix-Style Timeline Navigation**
Scrub like you scrub a movie.

- Horizontal timeline scrubber
- Hover to preview any moment
- Click to jump
- Search by app/file/time
- Tagging & bookmarking

**Why it matters:** Temporal browsing becomes intuitive, not technical.

### 4. **Forward AND Backward Scrubbing**
Most tools only go backward (undo).

- 🔙 Go back: "What was I doing?"
- ⏭️ Go forward: "How did this evolve?"
- 🔍 Explore: Understand your workflow

**Why it matters:** True temporal understanding, not just temporal undo.

### 5. **Desktop Restoration**
Full state recovery, not just file recovery.

- Click "restore to moment"
- Entire desktop state restored
- Apps open in original positions
- Windows positioned exactly as before
- Files open in original editors

**Why it matters:** You can literally go back in time, fully.

### 6. **Zero Data Leakage**
Everything local, everything controlled.

- ✅ Local storage only
- ✅ No cloud by default
- ✅ Zero telemetry
- ✅ Encrypted snapshots
- ✅ You own your history

**Why it matters:** Trust is the foundation of temporal computing.
